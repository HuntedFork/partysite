                        <div class="faq-item">
                            <h3 class="faq-title">I've never done this before, what should I expect?</h3>
                            <p class="faq-text">Mostly a fancy costume party with some roleplaying elements. When you walk in the door you'll be handed a 'character.' A piece of paper with an idea of who you're supposed to be, some things you know, and a couple things your character wants to get done over the course of the night.</p>
                        </div>   
                                          <div class="faq-item">
                            <h3 class="faq-title">How intense is it?</h3>
                            <p class="faq-text">Not. This is a decidedly laid back event that is welcoming of everyone, even if it's your first time roleplaying. You won't be expected to stay in character, and it's okay if you dont 'finish' all the things your character wants to do.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="faq-item">
                            <h3 class="faq-title">But I still need to dress up?</h3>
                            <p class="faq-text">Yeah. You don't need to have a crazy amazing costume or be super on theme, but at its heart this is a party about pretending to be in a different place in a different world. Don't take away from that.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="faq-item">
                            <h3 class="faq-title">Can I invite my friends?</h3>
                            <p class="faq-text">Yes. We have plenty of space this year. Please let me know if you're inviting more than 3 people I don't know, but it will be fine.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="faq-item">
                            <h3 class="faq-title">Should I arrive on time?</h3>
                            <p class="faq-text">Yes. This is a party that strongly rewards showing up early. We hand out the coolest characters at the beginning, showing up early lets you meet people before the game has truly begun, and most people will enjoy extra time in the space.</p>
                            <p class="faq-text">Also, if you plan on leaving before the end of the party please let us know at the door. </p>

                            <p class="faq-text">Grab a ticket! Get your costume! And then I'll see you at Mob Studios in Seattle at 7PM. Also, join the <a class="nav-link tm-nav-link" href="https://discord.gg/4N7rj5dJF6">discord.</a></p>

                        <h2 class="faq-section">The Theme</h2>
                        <hr class="mb-5">
                       <div class="faq-item">
                            <h3 class="faq-title">What's the full theme pitch?</h3>
                            <p class="faq-text">Coexisting beside our everyday world is another—vibrant, hidden, and brimming with magic. Creatures of myth and legend walk among us, cloaked in glamour, living their lives in the shadows of the mundane. Once a year, that secret world steps into the spotlight for The Siren Awards: the most prestigious celebration of underground fantasy music.</p>
                            <p class="faq-text">It’s the night when the veil lifts and the supernatural elite come out to shine. Celebrities, producers, paparazzi, and rising stars from every corner of the enchanted scene gather to honor the year’s most spellbinding sounds. Glamour crackles in the air. Old rivalries resurface. New legends are born. And everyone wants to be there—to see, to be seen, and to survive the wildest party of the year.</p>

                            <h3 class="faq-title">What should I aim for in my costume?</h3>
                            <p class="faq-text">Try aiming for one of these themes:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Red Carpet level fancy looks. (Tuxes, Ballgowns etc)</li>
                                <li>Fashionable artist icon looks. </li>
                                <li>Nice cocktail party or clubbing attire.</li>
                                <li>Outfits that mix fantasy and modern vibes.</li>
                                <li>Makeup/costume elements that help the urban fantasy theme. (Mascarade masks, devil horns, antlers, elf ears, elemental makeup)</li>
                                <li>Still confused? Checkout this <a class="nav-link tm-nav-link" href="https://www.pinterest.com/DnDLadyPerson/murder-mystery-music-producer-party-aesthetic/">Pinterest Board.</a> </li>
                            </ul>
                            <p class="faq-text">The only thing to avoid is any outfit that risks looking like you are in normal clothes. We want everyone dressed to the nines.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="faq-item">
                            <h3 class="faq-title">What if I don't have anything for the fantasy element?</h3>
                            <p class="faq-text">Don't sweat it. There's lots of normal humans who are simply 'In the know' about The Underground.</p>
